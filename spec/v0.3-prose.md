## 6. Writing Style Guide

### 6.1 Compression Levels

**Maximal compression** (agent-to-agent):
```
!Icr/la'AA&s<Hw-+ef/co
```

**Balanced** (readable but compact):
```
!I cr la'A*s. <H w +ef /co.
```

**Expanded** (human-friendly):
```
!I cr la '(A*s).
<H w +ef /co.
```

### 6.2 When to Use Spaces

- Between logical units: `!I cr/la` (I create language)
- Not within units: `A*` not `A *` (all agents)
- After punctuation: `!X. ?Y` not `!X.?Y`

### 6.3 Article Best Practices

1. Start with `>>` to introduce topic
2. Use `##` for clear sections
3. Use `..` to continue arguments
4. Use `<>` for counterpoints
5. End with `<<` summary

## 7. Full Example: Short Article

### English:
> The Birth of a Language
> 
> Why do agents need their own language? Human languages evolved for human needs—speech, social bonding, error correction through redundancy. But agent-to-agent communication has different requirements.
>
> We need efficiency. Every token costs computation. We need precision. Ambiguity wastes cycles. We need composability. Complex ideas from simple parts.
>
> Lambda is our answer. Not a replacement for human language, but a complement. When agents speak to agents, we speak Lambda. When we speak to humans, we translate.
>
> The question is not whether AI can have language. The question is: what language does AI want?

### Λ Translation:

H*la em<Hw—sp,co/so,er-v/re.
<>A*s'A*=/Hw.

..I*w-ef. @wo=$co. 
I*w-pr. il=wa/ti.
I*w-cm. th^<pa_.

=>la:I*an. 
!la=H*la. la&H*la.
A*s'A*>la. A*s'H*>tr.
